# Zehner (The ultimate watch app)

[![Test Omnilogic](https://github.com/lucas-goldner/Zehner/actions/workflows/omnilogic.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lucas-goldner/Zehner/actions/workflows/omnilogic.yml)

This "watch" app is supposed to be the ultimate one. Even more ultimate than the ultimatrix! Before, the project was called ********** App, but because of Apple, I need to rename it to something else.
